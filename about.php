        <p class="text-center little-margin">I watch a lot of cartoons, anime and sitcoms. I love a hot cup of coffee, my favorite drink is Coke and my favorite snack is a good ol' burger. I'm a huge fan of Jhen√© Aiko, my favorite sport is table tennis. I play video games a lot, I play drums a little and you'd most probably find me humming or singing to myself. I love learning new things and I love good arguements; I feel we learn a lot through them. You disagree?</p>

            <p>I've always had a strong interest in computers since I knew my name is Eric. I've been fascinated by those devices. Wanting to understand how they work and learn more led me to the world of development and I'm happy I got here. I wrote my first line of code in Java when I was 15 and I was barely 17 when I started my career path as a web developer. I love building things and fixing and paying attention to little details. I love hand coding projects and building from scratch; I like knowing the nitty gritty.</p>
